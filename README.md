## Objectives
The objective of this project is to explore the use of text simplification applications. Specifically, we focus on determining if a given textbook is appropriate for a student's reading level prior to assigning it as homework. In this paper, we present an analysis of various supervised and unsupervised methods for predicting text difficulty. For more information on the problem, please refer to the Kaggle competition [link](https://www.kaggle.com/t/5a1872e494574cc7bbf433fa8f4687d9)
